        <p>The microATX motherboard, often abbreviated as mATX, is a compact motherboard form factor that balances size and functionality. It is smaller than a standard ATX motherboard but larger than a mini-ITX motherboard. MicroATX motherboards are widely used in desktop computers and offer a good compromise between expandability and space savings, typically featuring multiple PCIe slots and RAM slots while fitting in a variety of computer cases.</p>
