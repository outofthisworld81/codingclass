    <p>A low-profile extension motherboard is a specialized variant of a motherboard designed to fit into compact computer cases with limited vertical space. These motherboards are typically thinner than standard ones and often feature horizontally oriented PCIe slots, allowing for the installation of additional components such as graphics cards in systems with constrained form factors, such as slim desktops or HTPCs (Home Theater PCs).</p>
