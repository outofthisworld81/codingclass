        <p>The WTX (Wedge Thermal eXpansion) motherboard is a now-obsolete form factor that was designed for high-end workstations and servers. Introduced by Intel in the late 1990s, it featured a large, horizontal layout to accommodate multiple CPUs and memory modules, as well as additional expansion slots and connectors for enhanced performance and scalability. While the WTX motherboard was once popular for workstation-class systems, it has been largely replaced by other form factors, such as ATX and EATX, in modern computing environments.</p>
